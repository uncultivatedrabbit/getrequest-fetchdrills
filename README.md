# getrequest-fetchdrills

Two small apps designed to practice making GET requests to public APIs. The first asks the user to enter a number of pics from 1-50 (default to 3) and the app returns that many random god photos from the dog API. The second app asks the user for a specific breed and renders a random photo of that breed (unless the breed doesn't exist in their database, in which case it throws an error).
